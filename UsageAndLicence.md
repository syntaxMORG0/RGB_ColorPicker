The Red value shows how red your color is so if you set the value of the max value (255) it will be
Verry red
```Python
R = 0 #Red Value
```
The Green value is basicly the same is red but makes it greener still the max value is 255
```python
G = 0 #Green Value
```
The blue value is also the same. values and stil has a max value 255. but if you sett all of the colors values 255 you will get white
```python
B = 0 #Blue Value
```
